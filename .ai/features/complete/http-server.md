# HTTP Server Integration âœ…

## Status: COMPLETE

## Description
HTTP server that automatically creates routes based on YAML configuration and forwards requests to appropriate domain processes via gRPC.

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: `lib/lang/adapters/start.go`, `lib/lang/adapters/http.go`
- **Port**: 8080 (HTTP server)
- **Router**: Go standard library `http.ServeMux`
- **Integration**: Connects HTTP requests to gRPC domain communication

## Features Implemented
- [x] Config-driven route registration
- [x] Automatic domain message routing
- [x] RESTful route support
- [x] Request payload extraction (POST/PUT body, GET query params)
- [x] JSON and HTML response handling
- [x] Template rendering integration
- [x] Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- [x] Error handling and status codes
- [x] Request correlation with unique IDs
- [x] Timeout handling (10 seconds per request)

## Route Configuration
Routes are automatically registered based on domain YAML configs:
```yaml
logic:
  http:
    restful: true
    routes:
      - method: GET
        link: user_index_request
        view: index  # Optional - triggers HTML template rendering
```

## Request Flow
1. HTTP request arrives at configured route
2. Request payload extracted and formatted
3. `DomainMessage` created with correlation ID
4. Message sent to domain via gRPC
5. Response received and formatted as JSON or HTML
6. Template rendering if `view` specified

## Response Formats

### JSON Response (no view)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "user_index_response", 
  "data": {...},
  "request_id": "http-1234567890"
}
```

### HTML Response (with view)
Renders template with layout support using Handlebars.

## Files
- Route creation logic in `start.go:CreateRouteDispatcher()`
- Handler logic in `start.go:createRouteHandler()`
- Server startup in `start.go:StartHTTPServerWithConfig()`

## Notes
- Seamless integration between HTTP and gRPC layers
- Flexible response handling (JSON/HTML)
- Good error handling and logging
- Ready for production traffic
