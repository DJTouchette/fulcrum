# Fulcrum Framework Features

This directory tracks the implementation status of all Fulcrum framework features.

## Directory Structure
- `complete/` - Features that are fully implemented and working
- `todo/` - Features that still need to be implemented

## Current Status Summary

### âœ… Completed Features (6/11)
1. **[Go CLI Runtime](complete/go-cli-runtime.md)** - CLI structure with Cobra
2. **[Config Parser](complete/config-parser.md)** - YAML configuration system  
3. **[gRPC Communication](complete/grpc-communication.md)** - Bidirectional streaming
4. **[HTTP Server Integration](complete/http-server.md)** - Route dispatch and responses
5. **[TypeScript Domain Framework](complete/typescript-domain-framework.md)** - Domain base classes and fluent APIs
6. **[Template System](complete/template-system.md)** - Handlebars rendering with layouts

### ðŸš§ TODO Features (5/11)

#### High Priority
1. **[Database Integration](todo/database-integration.md)** - PostgreSQL connection and schema generation
2. **[Process Management](todo/process-management.md)** - Automatic domain spawning and monitoring  
3. **[Model Validation](todo/model-validation.md)** - Runtime validation of YAML rules

#### Medium Priority
4. **[Hot Reloading](todo/hot-reloading.md)** - File watching and selective restarts
5. **[CLI Commands](todo/cli-commands.md)** - Production serve, build, generate commands

## Implementation Progress
**Overall: ~65% Complete**

The framework has a solid foundation with excellent communication architecture and developer experience features. The main gaps are in runtime integrations (database, validation) and production readiness (process management, build system).

## Next Steps Priority
1. **Database Integration** - Makes the framework actually functional
2. **Process Management** - Critical for usability (no manual domain starting)
3. **Model Validation** - Essential for data integrity
4. **Hot Reloading** - Improves developer experience
5. **CLI Commands** - Production readiness

## Feature Dependencies
- Hot Reloading depends on Process Management
- CLI Commands depend on Database Integration and Process Management
- Model Validation integrates with Database Integration

## Estimated Completion Timeline
- **High Priority Features**: 2-3 weeks
- **Medium Priority Features**: 1-2 weeks  
- **Full Framework**: 4-5 weeks

## Quality Standards
Each feature should include:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Integration tests
- Documentation
- Examples in the fulcrum-example project
